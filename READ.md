# 🛡️ Fake SSH Honeypot  

A **powerful and deceptive Python-based honeypot** designed to simulate an SSH server. This tool helps security enthusiasts, ethical hackers, and researchers analyze unauthorized access attempts and gather intelligence on malicious activities.  

🚨 **Disclaimer:** This tool is for educational and research purposes only. Unauthorized use on systems or networks that you do not own or have explicit permission to test is illegal and unethical.
